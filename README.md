Bird Song Generation using DDSP: Complete Plan
1. Overview
This project aims to generate realistic bird songs using Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP). The generated bird songs can be used to augment existing datasets, improving the training of classifiers by addressing the problem of data imbalance in ecological datasets. The project is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily generate high-quality synthetic bird songs from real-world recordings.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

Generate realistic bird songs using DDSP by modeling the harmonic and noise components of audio.
Provide synthetic data to aid in the improvement of classifiers that struggle with imbalanced datasets (e.g., bird species with fewer audio samples).
Enhance user understanding of the DDSP model and its applications in bioacoustic analysis.
3. What is DDSP?
Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) is a method for generating audio by directly learning the fundamental frequency (F0), loudness, and harmonic components of sound. Instead of generating waveforms sample by sample, DDSP enables precise control over sound qualities, which makes it ideal for generating natural sounds, such as bird songs, while controlling timbre, pitch, and environmental effects.

4. Detailed Step-by-Step Guide
4.1. Project Structure
Here’s a breakdown of the project structure and what each folder contains:

bash
Copy code
├── data/                       # Raw bird song data and preprocessed audio files
├── models/                     # Trained DDSP model and configuration files
├── scripts/                    # Python scripts for preprocessing, training, generation, and evaluation
├── results/                    # Generated synthetic bird songs and their spectrograms
├── requirements.txt            # List of required Python packages for the project
├── README.md                   # This file, explaining everything in detail
└── ...
data/: This folder will contain the bird song recordings you download and the processed files (e.g., spectrograms, F0, loudness) that are used as inputs for training.
models/: The folder where your trained DDSP model and any related configuration files are stored.
scripts/: All the Python scripts used to preprocess data, train the DDSP model, generate new bird songs, and evaluate the model’s performance.
results/: After running the generation script, your synthetic bird songs will be stored here.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the necessary Python packages you need to install to run the project.
README.md: This file explains how to use the repository in detail.
4.2. Installation
To get started, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-song-generation-ddsp.git
cd bird-song-generation-ddsp
Install the required dependencies: All the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Run the following command to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.3. Preparing Bird Song Data
You will need bird song recordings to train the DDSP model. The most common source is Xeno-Canto, where you can download bird sounds.

Download bird song recordings from Xeno-Canto or other sources.
Preprocess the audio by converting the recordings into a usable format for the DDSP model (e.g., extracting mel-spectrograms, F0, and loudness).
Use the script to preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/preprocess_data.py --data_path data/raw/ --output_path data/processed/
The preprocess_data.py script will extract mel-spectrograms and other features from the audio recordings and save them to the data/processed/ directory.
4.4. Training the DDSP Model
Once the data is prepared, you can train the DDSP model. This involves learning the patterns of bird songs so that the model can synthesize new ones.

Start training the model using the preprocessed data:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_ddsp.py --data_path data/processed/ --epochs 100
--data_path: Path to the preprocessed data.
--epochs: The number of training epochs (adjust based on your data and needs).
Monitor training progress: The script will print out metrics (e.g., loss, F0 accuracy, reconstruction quality) during the training process, allowing you to track how well the model is learning to generate bird songs.

4.5. Generating Synthetic Bird Songs
Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate new bird songs.

Generate synthetic bird songs using the trained DDSP model:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/generate_songs_ddsp.py --model_checkpoint models/ddsp_model.pth --output_path results/songs/
--model_checkpoint: Path to the trained model's checkpoint.
--output_path: Path to store the generated bird songs.
Review the generated bird songs: The newly generated bird songs will be saved as .wav files in the results/songs/ directory.

4.6. Evaluating the Model’s Performance
To check how well the synthetic bird songs perform (e.g., in classification tasks or quality assessments), you can run an evaluation.

Evaluate the generated songs using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/evaluate.py --generated_path results/songs/ --real_path data/processed/real_songs/
This script compares the synthetic songs to real songs and outputs metrics like F0 accuracy, loudness similarity, and spectrogram comparison.

5. Understanding the Key Concepts
5.1. Mel-Spectrograms
Mel-spectrograms represent audio in a visual form where the frequency components of sound are plotted over time. In this project, mel-spectrograms are used to train the DDSP model because they capture important features of bird songs.

5.2. Fundamental Frequency (F0)
F0 represents the pitch of a sound, which is crucial in bird song synthesis. The DDSP model uses F0 to generate harmonically accurate bird sounds.

5.3. Loudness
Loudness represents the amplitude of the sound over time. Accurate modeling of loudness helps to generate realistic bird songs that vary in intensity, just like real bird vocalizations.

5.4. Harmonics
In music and sound, harmonics are the overtone frequencies that accompany the fundamental frequency (F0). Modeling harmonics is essential for generating natural-sounding audio, including bird songs.

6. Results and Outcomes
6.1. Generated Songs
The synthetic bird songs generated by the DDSP model are highly realistic and can be used to augment datasets for tasks such as bird species classification.

6.2. Classifier Improvement
By adding synthetic songs to under-represented species in the dataset, classification accuracy improves. Users can compare the model performance before and after data augmentation using synthetic data.

7. Future Improvements
7.1. More Realistic Audio
Incorporating environmental effects such as wind and rain using DDSP can make the synthetic bird songs even more realistic.

7.2. Support for Multiple Species
The project can be extended to handle multiple species with different vocalization styles.
